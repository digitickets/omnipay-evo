This driver supports the remote Evo Payment Gateway (DPG) service. Payment information is sent and received via XML messages. Customers typically stay on the originating website with this method of integration.

## Installation

The Evo Omnipay driver is installed via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/). To install, simply add it
to your `composer.json` file:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "digitickets/omnipay-evo": "~2.0"
    }
}
```

And run composer to update your dependencies:

    $ curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
    $ php composer.phar update

## Basic Usage

This driver supports two transaction types:
 * Purchase (including 3D Secure support if card holder is registered)
 * Refund (you will need to send Evo's reference from the original transaction as the 'transactionReference' parameter.)
